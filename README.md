My Dot Files
============

This is a repository of my dot files strung together using a concept
called [Literate Programming][0] using [Emacs][1] and
[Org-Mode][2]. Via a process called tangling it *extracts* the code
blocks and *weaves* text, into comments, from the Org files and
creates the dot files.

For a good tutorial on how to put together your own dot files based
on this method see [Howard Abrams tutorial][3] and his more advanced
[dot files][4].
